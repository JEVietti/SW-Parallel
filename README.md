# SW-Parallel
Smith-Waterman Scoring Algorithm in Parallel

Using OpenMP shared memory approach, with parallel techniques using coarse and fine grained approach in tandem for an optimal solution.

Scoring calculated in both Serial and Parallel with Input String for genetic sequencing in the millions of lines.

Serial and Parallel Results recorded and drafted in a report.
